- gaining a complete sense of the world is optional but encouraged through game design
- game rewards unneccessary exploration

- the font sucks
- buggy

### GAME DESIGN: WHAT'S UP?

## !! **Here be SPOILERS**, for anyone who hasn't played through and is looking through the code

- game will revolve around central character's journey to the spaceport on an emergency mission to save humanity, then their journey through space and witnessing of the destruction of humanity

### WHAT ABOUT STORY?

## !!!!!!! **Like seriously**, don't come crying to me when you find out!

- for a few days, life operates normally
- mc trains as an off-duty astronaut would, preparing for a mission in 3 months.
* this training introduces the player to core game mechanics (fighting, movement, spaceship flying)

! alien invasion begins.
- character is sent out on a mission to the emergency spaceport on pheobe, along with others going to different ones, to bring supplies and fighters.
- character fights their way to the spaceport over the course of 3 days, while keeping in communication with central command
* central command is how the player is given access to the larger story, with major news events being told to the mc

! mc reaches the spaceport on earth
- the central command is collapsing as the aliens are trying to push in
- character fights through the spaceport with some guards, who help defend the spaceship while the mc sets up takeoff and takes off

! character takes off
- central command regains control of the center
- mc flies for a day, receiving positive news from centcom
- mc discovers ship was mildly damaged in takeoff but all sensors are reporting correctly
- mc goes into cryosleep for a week

! character awakens from cryosleep
- things have taken a turn for the worst
- most of the world has collapsed, the government has been destroyed
- centcom is fighting
- mc discovers sensor was not reporting correctly, the craft will miss pheobe and enter orbit of jupiter
- mc cannot communicate back to centcom because centcom has a broken reciever
- last communication is "craft zx&%*%$&^*... fly&Y*$ flyby &$(% phe&*(be..."

! game ends
